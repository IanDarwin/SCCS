= SCCS Reimplemented

This is a reimplementation of SCCS, the original Version Control System (VCS) for Unix.
AT&T's version of SCCS was, at the time, covered by restrictive licenses and copyright.
This reimplementation was done by David R. Galloway at the University of Toronto during
the early 1980's. 

While it may not be of use to anyone, the code is being placed here almost exactly 
as I received it from David (except for the addition of this README file).
